Fetch data from Fronter used by the schools in Oslo
===================================================

This script log into fronter and fetches information from all the
rooms you have access to and check the results into git.  This make it
easier to see what changed since the last time.

To run this script on a Debian machine, install the dependencies:

  apt-get install git lynx-cur libio-prompter-perl libwww-mechanize-perl \
      libconfig-inifiles-perl

and then run the update-git script.

 ./update-git

This will create a new git repository in a subdirectory and fetch the
front pages of all the accessable Fronter rooms, convert them to text
check them into git.  It will also show the difference for these text
files since the last run.

The latest version of this system is available from
https://github.com/petterreinholdtsen/fronter-scraper-oslo .
